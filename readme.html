      <p>I'll try to make this short and sweet because I don't like making readme's 
        (and this is my first one). I'll also try to make it so everybody can 
        understand, not just hardened CGI gurus. If you're having any problems 
        then please visit our support boards (<a href="http://www.sonicbarrier.net/apexboard/ikonboard.cgi">http://www.sonicbarrier.net/apexboard/ikonboard.cgi</a>) 
        and ask. No question is too dumb. I'm also offering temporary e-mail support 
        but I'm not promising prompt answers. My e-mail address is (<a href="mailto:dagur@sonicbarrier.net">dagur@sonicbarrier.net</a>).</p>
      <p>What you need before installing is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Webspace with CGI support. (Only a few free hosting company's support 
          CGI so check before<br>
          trying to install)</li>
        <li> You need to know how to do the following things with your ftp client:</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li> Upload in binary and ASCII modes</li>
        <li> 
          <p> And if you're on a UNIX server (most are) you need to know how<br>
            to set permissions (CHMOD). This is not a complicated thing to do<br>
            and almost all ftp programs can do this. Most of the time you can<br>
            simply right-click on the file you want to chmod and then choose<br>
            the attributes.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ok now let's get our hands dirty. The first thing you need to do is edit 
        the first line in 'apexnews.cgi' and 'setup.cgi'. By default it says &quot;<b>#!/usr/bin/perl</b>&quot;. 
        Now this will work on most servers but not all. If this line is incorrect 
        you will get an error (500) instantly when trying to run those files. 
        If you don't know what the first line should be then it's usually easy 
        to obtain that information on the hosts website. I can't help<br>
        you with that.</p>
      <p>Now it's time to upload. Notice that in your zipfile the files are kept 
        in two main folders called 'CGI' and 'Images'. This is because they should 
        be uploaded to two different places on the server. The images should be 
        uploaded to an ordinary folder in <b>binary mode</b>. But the contents 
        of the 'CGI' folder, the script itself and it's files, should be uploaded 
        to a cgi enabled directory in <b>ASCII mode</b>. Usually there's already 
        a directory on your webspace called &quot;cgi-bin&quot;, you should use 
        that. If there is none you should create one. Make sure it's chmoded 777. 
        Now you should upload the content's of the 'CGI' folder into the cgi-bin. 
        I recommend creating a special folder inside the cgi-bin folder for those 
        files. Note: All folders inside the cgi-bin should be chmoded 777 (if 
        your server doesn't allow that then 755 should be fine). </p>
      <p>Now that you've uploaded the files you must chmod the following files 
        <b>755</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>apexnews.cgi</li>
        <li>setup.cgi</li>
        <li>textfiles/default.txt</li>
        <li>styles/default.htm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You're almost finished. Now you only need to run setup.cgi with your 
        browser and follow the instructions there.</p>
      <p>Now try posting something, if that works it's on to the final part of 
        the installation:</p>
      <p class="head" align="center">SSI</p>
      <p>Important:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> not all servers allow SSI but most of those who allow CGI also allow 
          SSI. </li>
        <li> The html files in which you use SSI will probably have to have the 
          extension '<b>.shtml</b>' <br>
          (e.g. index.shtml instead of index.html) because few servers allow SSI 
          in files with <br>
          the '.html' or '.htm' extensions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><br>
        This version of ApexNews creates .txt files for the output and puts them 
        in the 'textfiles' directory. The textfiles have the same name as your 
        profiles. For example, you have a 'default' profile when you install the 
        script so all output for that profile is in a file called 'default.txt'. 
        Now you need to include the files into your html files using 'Server Side 
        Includes' (or just SSI). These are special tags you can put anywhere in 
        your html and the next time you view your html page on your server you 
        will see the contents of your textfile there.</p>
      <p>SSI can be a headache for people who are not used to them so it's often 
        trial and error that is needed. Let's create a scenario:</p>
      <p>Let's say that ApexNews is installed in'http://www.somesite.com/cgi-bin/ApexNews' 
        (URL not absolute path) and your hompage is at 'http://www.somesite.com' 
        Then we would add this tag to the html file:</p>
      <p align="left"> &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;<b>/cgi-bin/ApexNews/textfiles/default.txt</b>&quot; 
        --&gt;<br>
        or<br>
        &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;<b>cgi-bin/ApexNews/textfiles/default.txt</b>&quot; 
        --&gt; </p>
      <p align="left">If it's default.txt that you want to include. Notice that 
        the path in the SSI tag is <b>relative to the html file</b>!</p>
      <p align="left">Troubleshooting:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <div align="left">If you get a [An error occurred while processing this 
            directive] this means that the path is wrong. Try different variations 
            but it that doesn't work try to use 'file' instead of virtual. The 
            difference between these two is that file uses the absolute path but 
            not the URL. So try either<br>
            <br>
            &lt;!--#include file=&quot;<b>cgi-bin/ApexNews/textfiles/default.txt</b>&quot; 
            --&gt; (no forward slash in front)<br>
            or<br>
            &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;<b>/home/public_html/cgi-bin/ApexNews/texfiles/default.txt</b>&quot; 
            --&gt; (The full path to default.txt. Starts with a forward slash)</div>
        </li>
        <li>If you get nothing check the source of your page and see if the SSI 
          tag is still there. If so it probably means that your host doesn't allow 
          SSI. It could also mean that you have the wrong extension on your file 
          (remember that <b>.shtml</b> is most common). If the tag is not there 
          you should check your default.txt file and see if it has any contents. 
          If not then post something in your Admin CP. </li>
